                    <p>See, I've always been a builder. Just not in code. I formulate game strategies. Trading systems. Ways to optimize what already existed. But I hit a ceiling: I could see what needed to exist, but I couldn't make it exist. I needed to automate my own projects.</p>

                    <p>Then I found N8n. Claude. The no-code/low-code revolution.</p>

                    <p>Now I build the tools I need instead of waiting for someone else to make them. Client needs a workflow that connects 5 apps and makes decisions based on context? Done. Want an AI that understands their business without them typing a novel? Done.</p>

                    <p>That's what you're looking at right now. I built this site from scratch. With AI assistance. Someone who knew nothing about web development a couple of months ago.</p>

            <div class="content-card">
                <p class="emphasis">Look - automation and AI aren't replacing us. They're weapons.</p>
                <p>The question is: are you holding the tool or dodging it?</p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p>I'm teaching this in Tambayan PH because I watched too many talented Filipinos grinding 60-hour weeks doing work that could be automated. Not because they're lazy. Because they don't know the tools exist.</p>

                        <h4>Compete globally</h4>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>I don't want to just build for clients. I want to teach builders. So the next wave of Filipino entrepreneurs isn't outsourcing automation - they're doing it.</p>
