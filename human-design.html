            <p class="hero-subtitle">
                Back in 2022, a friend asked me about Human Design.<br>
                I was an undergraduate student studying Pharmacy, with a passion for esotericism, analyzing and trading crypto charts for fun.

                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>So when she showed me this system that mixed astrology, I Ching, chakras, and quantum physics into one framework... I figured it was either brilliant or completely insane.</p>

                    <p class="emphasis">Turned out to be both.</p>

                    <p>See, I've always been the person who can't just use something. I need to reverse-engineer it. Take it apart. Understand the wiring underneath. Whether that's a video game character's skill tree, a market pattern, or apparently, the operating system of a human being.</p>

                    <p>So I dove in.</p>

                    <p>Started with my own chart. Then my family's. Friends. Random people who'd let me experiment on them. And something weird kept happening - people would cry. Not sad crying. The "holy shit someone finally sees me" kind.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-card">
                <div class="quote-marks">"</div>
                <div class="quote-content">
                    <p>They'd say things like: "How did you know that about me?" or "I've never told anyone this before but..." or "Can you do my partner's chart? My kid's? My boss's?"</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>I wasn't trying to start a business. I was just... studying. The way some people study birds or engines. Except my subject was: Why do humans do the completely illogical things they do?</p>

                    <p>And the system of Human Design had answers. Real ones. The kind that make you go "oh THAT'S why I've been forcing myself to wake up early when my body literally works better at night" or "oh THAT'S why networking events drain me but one-on-one conversations energize me."</p>

                    <p>People started offering to pay me. Which felt weird at first because I was basically just translating their birth data through this system I'd obsessed over. But they insisted. Said the clarity was worth more than therapy.</p>

                    <p class="emphasis">So now here we are. Hundreds of readings later. Mostly Filipinos, some foreigners. Business owners, creatives, VAs trying to figure out their next move, parents confused about their kids.</p>

                <p class="emphasis">Human Design isn't fortune telling.</p>

                <p>It's not a prescription for happiness or a guarantee you'll suddenly have your shit together. It's more like... imagine you've been driving a manual car thinking it's automatic. You've been grinding gears for 20 years. And someone finally says "dude, that's a stick shift."</p>

                <p>That's what a reading is. I'm showing you the manual (astronomically accurate) you were born with but nobody handed you.</p>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3 class="feature-title">The Foundation Is Mathematical</h3>
                    <p>Your birth time, location, and the planetary positions at that moment - plus 88 days before (when your neo-cortex fully formed). Those data points create your chart.</p>
                    <p class="emphasis">It's not mystical. It's astronomical.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3 class="feature-title">The Art Is In The Interpretation</h3>
                    <p>There's quantum physics and ancient wisdom woven through this. But what matters is whether it helps you stop forcing yourself into shapes that were never yours to begin with.</p>

            </div>

                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>Look - I get it. "Birth chart stuff" sounds like astrology on steroids. Some people think it's bullshit. That's fine. I'm not here to convert anyone.</p>

                    <p class="emphasis">But if you're someone who's tried therapy, self-help books, productivity systems, and you still feel like you're swimming upstream... maybe your problem isn't motivation. Maybe you simply need a fresh perspective.</p>

            <div class="content-card">
                <p>And yeah - sometimes the accuracy is unnerving. I'll mention something about how your body processes food or how you need your workspace set up, and you're sitting there like "how the f**k did you know that?"</p>

                <p class="emphasis">I didn't. Your chart did.</p>

                <p>Also - the reading isn't just information. There's something about the way I explain it that people say shifts things. They leave feeling calm. Refreshed. Seen.</p>
